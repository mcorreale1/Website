					<h2>HackRPI</h2>
					<p>Competed in my first hackathon ever at RPI in November, 2014.
						My team used the Myo, a device that you wear around your wrist 
						that monitors your movement and allows you to interact with applications
						through C++ and though Lua, as well as a user-made framework that allowed
						the myo to be read with javascript directly into a website. This was a huge
						learning experience for me as a programmer in the fields of javascript, lua,
						c++, and most importantly, how to opterate with a team of programmers
						who are a lot smarter than I am.

					<h2>Treehouse PHP</h2>
					<p>Completed entire HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript course, 
						which included popular frameworks such as JQuery and Sass.
						I also completely overhauled the CSS to make it 
						responsive with mobile devices, without the use of bootstrap, 
						for practice on CSS and styling, as well as further PHP customization.
